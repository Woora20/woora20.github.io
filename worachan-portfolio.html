            </p>

            <p>
                I am a dedicated UX/UI Designer with a strong foundation in creating intuitive, visually appealing
                interfaces.<br>
                Experienced with tools like Figma, I'm passionate about enhancing user experiences and aligning designs
                with business
                goals.<br>
                Although early in my journey, I value collaboration and am committed to continuously improving my skills
                to deliver
                impactful design solutions.

                <h3>How I Discovered UX/UI Design</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2025-07-12">July 12, 2025</time></p>
                <p>
                    As a computer engineering student, I never planned to get into design. My world was algorithms,
                    databases, and
                    coding assignments. Everything changed when I took an elective design course in my third year. The
                    professor
                    showed us how apps and websites we use daily were carefully crafted to solve user problems. I was
                    fascinated
                    that design wasn't just about aesthetics â€“ it was about understanding human behavior and creating
                    solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started experimenting with Figma during free time, watching YouTube tutorials and redesigning apps
                    I used
                    regularly. My first attempts were terrible â€“ I focused only on making things look pretty without
                    considering
                    user needs. But the design process hooked me. The combination of creativity and logical
                    problem-solving felt
                    like the perfect blend of art and engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I decided to apply for a UX/UI design internship, my friends thought I was crazy. "Why would an
                    engineering
                    student do design?" But I believed my technical background could be an advantage. I was right â€“ it
                    became my
                    biggest strength.
